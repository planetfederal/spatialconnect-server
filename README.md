# spatialconnect-server

This server is the interface used to communicate with mobile clients
using the SpatialConnect libraries.  It's also the API that powers the
dashboard web application.

The development server used webpack & npm to install React, Immutable, & Redux.
using the SpatialConnect libraries.  It's also the API that powers the
dashboard web application.

## Running with Docker

First you have to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for your local workstation.

#### On OS X

If you are developing on OS X, make sure that your Docker host vm is started `docker-machine ls` and that your shell is configured to use it `eval $(docker-machine env default)`.

Additionally, to enable a more pleasant experience, you'll need to install [docker-osx-dev](https://github.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev) so you don't have to rebuild the container every time you change a file.

```
curl -o /usr/local/bin/docker-osx-dev https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev/master/src/docker-osx-dev
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-osx-dev
docker-osx-dev install
```

After installing, you need to run `docker-osx-dev` in one terminal and do your work in another.


### Running all the images

To setup all of the spatialconnect infrastructure for the first time, use docker-compose to
setup the dependent services.

```
docker-compose up -d zookeeper kafka schema-registry postgres
```

Then add the bottled water extension to the postgres database.  First
open a `psql` terminal on the postgres image

```
docker-compose run -e PGHOST=postgres -e PGUSER=postgres --rm postgres psql
```

then add the extension

```
create extension bottledwater;
```

Now in another terminal, start the bottledwater client by running

```
docker-compose up -d bottledwater
```


To start the spatialconnect container, run

```
docker-compose up -d spatialconnect
```

To see all the changes to the event table, run the kafka console consumer for the `event` topic

```
docker-compose run --rm consumer --from-beginning --topic event
```

### Testing the API and dashboard

You can explore the API by using the explorer at http://default/explorer/

The web app dashboard is at the root http://default

> The hostname "default" should be setup in your /etc/hosts from docker-osx-dev,
> but if not you can find the IP address with `docker-machine ip default` and
> add the entry yourself


When you're done, don't forget to shut it down with

```
docker-compose stop
```

And if you want to remove all the containers, you can run

```
docker-compose rm -vf
```


### Running the example apps
To run the example apps you first must change to the ExampleProject
directory

```
cd ExampleProject/
```

To start the Android app, first you need to start an emulator.  Then you
can run

```
react-native run-android
```

To run the iOS app, run

```
react-native run-ios
```

### Signing the example apps

First you will need to obtain the signing key file and passwords from one of the project
leaders.  Email spatialconnect@boundlessgeo.com to request it.

#### Signing the Android app

To generate a signed APK, you need to change to the
`ExampleProject/android` directory and run

```
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Then you can find the distributable app at
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk`.

If you want to install this signed apk to your local device to test, run

```
./gradlew installRelease
```
